Lyrics-to-audio Alignment with Fine-level Complementary Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
In this chapter, we propose how to improve the baseline lyrics-to-audio
 alignment method by considering facets of fine-level context, complementary
 to lyrics.
 We focus on one particular fine-level facet — the accents in the metrical
 cycle (i.e.
 metrical accents).
 In sung voice, transitions between consecutive lyrics units are aligned
 with the metrical accents to a certain degree.
 However, we found that it is not obvious how to conceptualize the direct
 relation of metrical accents to syllable transitions.
 Instead, we investigate the relation of metrical accents to the locations
 of onsets (attacks) of sung notes in the vocal melody.
 In this way, the influence of metrical events on syllable transitions is
 represented implicitly through its influence on note onsets, which are
 in turn influenced by metrical events.
 In this sense, metrical accents can be considered a facet of complementary
 context of lyrics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
With this motivation, we propose in the first part of the chapter a vocal
 onset detector that considers the simultaneously occurring accents in a
 metrical cycle.
 Vocal onset detection can be seen as a subtask of singing voice transcription.
 That is why we propose how to extend a state of the art probabilistic model
 for singing voice transcription, in which a priori probability of a note
 at a specific position in the metrical cycle interacts with the probability
 of observing a vocal note onset.
 Designing in a compact manner meter-aware transition probabilities between
 consecutive notes is the first major contribution of this chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
In the second part of the chapter, we address the relation of the transitions
 between consecutive phonemes to the simultaneously occurring vocal onsets.
 A well-known fact is that when singing voice advances from the current
 syllable to another one, simultaneously with the change of timbre a vocal
 onset is perceived 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sundberg1990science"

\end_inset

.
 That is to say, the first voiced sound in a syllable bears the onset of
 a new note.
 
\color inherit
The second major contribution of this chapter is conceptualizing onset-aware
 phoneme transition rules
\color black
, 
\color inherit
because such relations between vocal onsets and phonemes have not been previousl
y formalized in a computational study.

\color black
 We propose further how to integrate these rules into the
\color inherit
 transition model of a phonetic recognizer.
 This contributes to alignment based on knowledge about the vocal onsets.

\color black
  To test the feasibility of the proposed model, we aligned the lyrics utilizing
 manually annotated onsets.
 
\color inherit
Further, we explore how automatically detected vocal onsets can replace
 the annotations.
 Using automatic singing transcription to detect the vocal onsets instead
 of score-informed methods reduces the need for music scores.

Singing voice transcription
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of converting an audio recording into some form of music notation
 is commonly known as automatic music transcription.
 Current transcription methods use general purpose models, which are unable
 to capture the rich diversity found in music signals from different instruments
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "benetos2013automatic"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, singing voice poses a challenge to transcription algorithms
 because of its soft onsets and expressive elements such as portamento and
 vibrato.
 
\color black
In recent years there has been a substantial amount of work on the extraction
 of pitch from both

 and predominant singing voice from polyphonic music 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "salamon2014melody"

\end_inset

.
 This has paved the way to an increased accuracy of singing voice transcription
 algorithms.
 One of the reasons for this is that a correctly detected melody contour
 is a fundamental precondition for 
\color inherit

\color black
 (SVT).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core subtasks of SVT are detecting note events with a discrete pitch
 value, an onset time and an offset time from the estimated time-pitch represent

, wherein a note has 3 states: attack (onset), stable pitch state and silent
 state.
 The transition probabilities are learned from data.
 Recently 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 suggested to represent the observation and transition likelihoods by rules
 compacted from music knowledge, instead of learning them from data.
 The model covers a range with distinct pitches from a lowest MIDI tone
 C2 up to B7.
 
\color black
Each MIDI pitch is further divided into 3 sub-pitches, resulting in

Although being conceptually capable of tracking onsets in singing voice
 audio with accompaniments, these approaches were tested only on

 In multi-instrumental recordings, an essential first step is to extract
 reliably the predominant vocal melody.
 One of the few works dealing with SVT for polyphonic recordings —

 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 as a primary step of the note transcription stage, notes are segmented
 by a set of flamenco-specific onset detection rules, based on pitch contour
 and volume characteristics.
 
\end_layout

Vocal onsets are usually soft (a slower attack phrase), in contrast to some
 instruments with percussive onsets

 This makes the precise location of a vocal onset ill-defined.

The note onset corresponds to the initial segment of the three temporal
 segments of a vocal note: attack, sustain and release

 As the location of a note onset we will refer to the time instant, in which
 a pitched segment starts.
 They could follow (but exclude) a region with higher energy in case a syllable
 starts with a non-voiced consonant.
 The other temporal segments — sustain and release (offset) have undoubtedly
 also impact on the transition of phonemes.
 
\color inherit
However, in this thesis, we consider the impact of vocal note onsets only,
 for they have arguably the most evident influence on syllable transitions.

 Most algorithms are based on the observation that an onset entails a change
 of the energy of the signal or of its harmonic content.
 One successful approach is to distinguish the spectral peaks, which are
 due to candidate note transient time segments

 Soft onsets are treated as a special case: the sensitivity of the generic
 transient detector is modified whenever the transients appear in a harmonic
 structure, which is usually a condition for soft onsets.

\color black
Metrical accents are a facet of complementary context that defines the rhythmic
 backbone of vocal melodies.
 Therefore it is worth studying how the transitions between lyrics of units
 (in particular syllables) interact with these accents.
 
\color inherit
By 
\emph on
metrical accents
\emph default
 we will refer to notes that are emphasized as a result of the context of
 the musical meter.
 Naturally, accents occur on the beats, whereby downbeats (the first beat
 in a meter) will be perceived as being stronger accentuated.
 Detecting the times of vocal note onsets can benefit from automatically
 detected metrical events, such as beats.
 
\color black
In fact, the accents in a metrical cycle determine to a large extent the
 temporal backbone of the singing melody.

Studies on symbolic music data showed that the timestamps of vocal note
 onsets are influenced by the their position in a metrical cycle

 We adopted the first two segments: attack region (A), stable pitch region

 We replaced the silent segment with non-vocal state (N).
 Because full-fledged note transcription is outside the scope of this work,
 instead of 3 steps per semitone, we used for simplicity only a single one,
 which deteriorated just slightly the note onset detection accuracy.
 Also, to reflect the pitch range in the datasets, on which we evaluate,
 we set as minimal MIDI note E3 covering almost 3 octaves up to B5 (35 semitones

 This totals to 105 note states.

 Transition from one tempo to another is allowed only at bar positions,
 at which the beat changes.
 This is a reasonable assumption for the local tempo deviations in the analyzed

 In this work we make the assumption that the observed vocal pitch and the
 observed metrical accent are conditionally independent from each other.
 This assumption may not hold in cases when energy accents of singing voice,
 which contribute to the total energy of the signal, are correlated to changes
 in pitch.
 However, for music with percussive instruments the importance of singing
 voice accents is diminished to a significant extent by percussive accents.
 Now we can rewrite Eq.

Vocal detection is evaluated on 5 1-minute excerpts from each of the two
 usuls from the 
\emph on

\emph default
 (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Multi-instrumental-vocal-onsets"

\end_inset

), totaling in 10 minutes of audio (on total 780 onsets).
 The hopsize of computing the spectral flux feature, which resulted in best
 beat detection accuracy in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "holzapfel2014tracking"

\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{f}=20\thinspace ms$
\end_inset

.
 In comparison,
\series bold
 
\series default
the hopsize of predominant vocal melody detection is usually of smaller
 order i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{p}=5.8\thinspace ms$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to 256 frames at sampling rate of 44100).
 Preliminary experiments showed that extracting pitch with values of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{p}$
\end_inset

 bigger than this values reasonably deteriorated the vocal onset accuracy.
 Therefore in this work we used hopsize of 5.8 ms for the extraction of both
 features.
 The time difference parameter for the spectral flux computation remains
 unaffected by this change in hopsize, because it can be set separately.

 Note that in

 the authors introduce a post-processing step, in which onsets of consecutive
 sung notes with same pitch are detected considering their intensity difference.
 We excluded this step in all system variants presented, because it could
 not be integrated in the proposed observation model in a trivial way.
 This means that, essentially, in this experiments cases of consecutive
 same-pitch notes are missed, which decreases somewhat the recall compared
 to the original algorithm.

As a precursor to evaluating the full-fledged model, we conducted an experiment
 with manually annotated beats.
 This is done to test the general feasibility of the proposed note transition

\end_inset

 and in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In preliminary experiments we saw that with annotated beats the simple
 weighting results in much worse onset accuracy than the time-redistributed
 one.
 Therefore the experimental results reported are conducted with the latter
 weighting scheme.

 evidences also a reasonable improvement of the vocal onset detection accuracy
 for both music traditions.
 The results reported are only with the simple weighting scheme for the
 vocal note onset transition model (the time-redistribution weighting was
 not implemented in this experiment).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adding the automatic beat tracking improved the baseline, whereas this was
 not the case with manual beats for simple weighting.
 This suggests that the concurrent tracking of beats and vocal onsets is
 a flexible strategy and can accommodate some vocal onsets, slightly time-shifte
d from a beat.
 We observe also that the vocal onset accuracy is on average a bit inferior
 to that with manual beat annotations (done with the time-redistribution
 weighting).

 In this way the influence of metrical events on syllable transitions is
 represented implicitly through its influence on vocal note onsets, which
 are in turn influenced by metrical events.

As we saw in the previous chapter, automatically determining the time positions
 of transitions between sung syllables can be greatly  assisted by information
 from the music score.
 Similarly, by relying on music score, one can infer automatically the timestamp
s of vocal note onsets.
 Such timestamps are estimated reasonably well by a recent study on automatic
 score-to–audio alignment

Since we intend that the proposed methodologies can be applicable for material
 with no music scores available, we preferred to apply automatic vocal onset
 detection instead of score-to-audio alignment.
 Detecting vocal onsets in any setting is arguably one of the hardest

The transition to a consecutive lyrics syllable implies a concurrent transition
 to a new note.
 The onset of the new note occurs usually at the start of the first voiced
 sound in the syllable.
 If we look at this reversely, the occurrence of note attack in a sung melody
 can signal a phonetic transition.
 The transition depends on the phoneme types, since, for example, a new
 note cannot start at unvoiced consonants.
 Taking advantage of that fact, we formulate rules that guide the transition
 between consecutive phonemes when a note onset is present.
 In general, we consider note onsets (attack) events as complementary context
 of phonetic timbre.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we assessed the contribution of explicitly representing
 metrical accents (fine-level complementary context) for improving the tracking
 of sung lyrics.

\color black
 We studied the relation of metrical accents to lyrics in two steps: how
 metrical accents interact with vocal onsets and how the latter, in turn,
 interact with phoneme transitions.
 In this way, the influence of metrical events on syllable transitions is
 represented implicitly through its influence on note onsets, which are
 in turn influenced by metrical events.
 
\color inherit
Therefore, we presented two separate probabilistic models for two separate
 tasks: metrical-accent-aware vocal onset detection and onset-aware lyrics-to-au
dio alignment.
 We carry out an evaluation on material from

Metrical-accent-aware vocal onset detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We strived to improve the automatic vocal note onset detection by incorporating
 information about their position in a metrical cycle (i.e.
 metrical accents).
 
\color black
To this end we proposed a

 for the simultaneous tracking of metrical position and vocal onsets.
 The main contribution is that the approach integrates in one coherent model
 two existing state of the art probabilistic approaches for different tasks:
 beat tracking and singing voice transcription.

We carried out an evaluation on a multi-instrument dataset from

 with two different usul (meter) types.
 Context knowledge about the usul is built within the transition model of
 the

.
 Results confirmed that the proposed model reasonably improves vocal note
 onset detection accuracy compared to a baseline model that does not take
 the metrical position into account.
 The F-measure rises from 31% to 36 % for the düyek usul, which has better
 beat detection F-measure and from 38 to 40 % for aksak usul.

We extended the phonetic recognizer approach
\series bold
 
\series default
\color inherit
by modeling the singing voice onsets, occurring simultaneously with phoneme
 transitions.
 We conceptualized onset-aware phoneme transition rules
\color black
 and proposed how to integrate them into the
\color inherit
 transition model of the phonetic recognizer.
 The method was tested on an 
\emph on
a cappella
\emph default
 OTMM dataset.
 The new model resulted in a slight improvement of from 79.2 % for baseline,
 unaware of singing voice onsets, to 81.7 %.
 In particular, the onsets due to rules discouraging premature transition,
 the states of sustained vowels were allowed to have longer durations.
